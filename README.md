Turn2us Apprentice Technical Test
IntroductionFor the Turn2us Apprenticetechnical test we would like you to create a basic home page with an age checker with a button to verify the user is old enough to be eligible for benefits. 
The age restriction toapply for benefits is 18 years old so anyone below this age is not eligible. 
Feel free to refer to a benefit you know about in our welfare system.
If eligible, the user will see a success page saying they are eligible to apply, and if they are not old enough, they should see apage letting them know they are too young to proceed (3 pages in total). 

We ask you not to spend more than a maximum of three hours on this test.
We are not expecting a finished product so do the best you can and have fun!
