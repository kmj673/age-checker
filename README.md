# age-checker

## user story

- a basic home page with an age checker with a button to verify the user is old enough to be eligible for benefits.
- The age restriction to apply for benefits is 18 years old so anyone below this age is not eligible.
- the user will see a success page saying they are eligible to apply, and if they are not old enough, they should see apage letting them know they are too young to proceed.
