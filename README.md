Turn2us Apprentice Technical Test  <br>
IntroductionFor the Turn2us Apprenticetechnical test we would like you to create a basic home page with an age checker with a button to verify the user is old enough to be eligible for benefits.   <br>
The age restriction toapply for benefits is 18 years old so anyone below this age is not eligible.   <br>
Feel free to refer to a benefit you know about in our welfare system.  <br>
If eligible, the user will see a success page saying they are eligible to apply, and if they are not old enough, they should see apage letting them know they are too young to proceed (3 pages in total).   <br>

We ask you not to spend more than a maximum of three hours on this test.  <br>
We are not expecting a finished product so do the best you can and have fun!  <br>
Tasks  <br>
1.Break up the tasks above into different user stories.  <br>
2.Create an issue for each user story in a new GitHub repository.  <br>
3.Attempt to build the three pages, age checker input box and button.   <br>
4.If you complete the three main tasks above, feel free to enhance the pages to further demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills with any left-over time you may have.
